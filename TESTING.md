- ### Bugs and Errors found
1) The idea for the render new word function code was taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ93TTdGxa8. The bug found was after the word was successfully typed and new word was rendered, however you have to type the inital word and then the second word.
this was fixed by adding a section to the formula to change the innerText of the wordDisplay formula showing the '' after the word has been correctly typed.
![Two Words showing to be inputted](assets/images/readme.md-images/two-words-show-to-be-inputted.png)
2) The English keyboard is not set up for easy typing of german punctuation - for example on the word MÃ¼ller. 
Words that had umlaut were taken out of the german.words.js data source.
![Umlaut-error](assets/images/readme.md-images/umlaut-error.png)
3) Favicon. The Favicon added was not loading. This was due to it not having the link added in HTML.
![favicon-error](assets/images/readme.md-images/favicon-error.png)
4) The Character Logging. Through time remaining this is an outstanding bug. 
![Chracter Logging](assets/images/readme.md-images/character-log-error.png).
As you can see on the screen shot the log does not start on zero. This is a function error that through lack of time has not been fixed.
